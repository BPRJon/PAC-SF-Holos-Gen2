# PAC> SF Holos Gen2
A set of starfall chips that take the PAC>E2 conversion holo data and turns them into SF Holo Data compatible with my Holo Creator (included)

# How to use

- Convert your pac into E2 holos with the built in tool
- Open the E2 and copy **ONLY** the Holo Data
- Paste the holo data into the `Holo Data goes here!!!` area
- Spawn the Starfall, it will give you an info pop up saying 'Copied text to clipboard' after 2 seconds
- Open up Holo Creator and paste the CreationTable, it should have all of your hologram data
- Spawn the Holo Creator and confirm all of your holos have loaded properly

# If you have issues
Please either make an issue on here or message me on discord (bprjon)
